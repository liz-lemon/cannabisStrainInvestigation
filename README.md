# cannabis_strain_investigation
BrainStation Capstone


I've always been curious to explore the effects and flavours of cannabis strains, specifically if there is a great enough distinction between hybrid, indica and sativa plants. 

This repository contains:

	- CIS.ipynb: A jupyter notebook with the entire analysis process
	
	- Datafiles: All of the files I used including scripts and images. 
	
This is my first data science project - please feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions.
Thanks for looking :)
